Bonus (AI-Powered Matching):
If you want to enhance document matching, you can integrate AI-based similarity analysis:
a. OpenAI API (GPT models)
b. Google Gemini
c. DeepSeek AI
d. Self-hosted NLP models (e.g., spaCy, BERT, Llama2)
AI models can improve semantic similarity detection beyond basic word matching.


Evaluation Criteria:
1. Functionality: Do the credit system and document matching features work correctly?
2. Performance: Can the system handle multiple users and large document datasets?
3. Security: Are user passwords and data stored securely?
4. Scalability: Can the system support multiple users on a local server?
5. Code Quality: Is the code clean, modular, and well-documented?
6. AI Bonus: If AI-powered document matching is implemented, how effectively does it improve accuracy?


I am particularly interested in applying my knowledge of AI and data science to practical, impactful projects, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to BASIS VECTORS CAPITAL. I believe my academic background and skills in AI and machine learning make me an excellent candidate for AI Enthusiast.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.
