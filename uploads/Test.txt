I am currently pursuing my B.Tech. in Data Science, where I have gained a strong foundation in machine learning algorithms, data manipulation, and data analysis. Through my coursework, I have developed hands-on experience in various machine learning models, including supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, as well as deep learning algorithms. I am proficient in Python and have worked extensively with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn for data preprocessing, analysis, and building predictive models.  My skills in data manipulation and feature engineering have allowed me to prepare large, complex datasets for analysis and model development. In addition, my ability to apply machine learning algorithms to real-world problems positions me well to contribute to your AI-driven initiatives.  I am particularly interested in applying my knowledge of AI and data science to practical, impactful projects, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to BASIS VECTORS CAPITAL. I believe my academic background and skills in AI and machine learning make me an excellent candidate for AI Enthusiast.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.




Bonus (AI-Powered Matching):
If you want to enhance document matching, you can integrate AI-based similarity analysis:
a. OpenAI API (GPT models)
b. Google Gemini
c. DeepSeek AI
d. Self-hosted NLP models (e.g., spaCy, BERT, Llama2)
AI models can improve semantic similarity detection beyond basic word matching.
